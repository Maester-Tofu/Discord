# Discord

Heyo, Please respect others here as they're all my friends or people I'm getting to know. 
Join your respective channels if you decide to use any. 
Don't be a stranger, if I could be friends with them, so can you :). 
Be respectful to other people and have a good time. 
If there are any quarels with anyone with regards to the server, please notify me and I will try my best to solve the issue. 
I'm not afraid to ban people :^) so be respectful (this doesn't mean be nice).
